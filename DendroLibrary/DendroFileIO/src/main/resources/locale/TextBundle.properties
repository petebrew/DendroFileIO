tucson.range.8000BC            = Values before 8000BC are unrepresentable in Tucson format files.  The output file is likely to be viewed as invalid by some programs but we will nevertheless try to continue.
tucson.range.8000BCand2000AD   = Your dataset spans from before 1AD until after 2000AD.  The Tucson format is unable to represent years BC so the +8000 year workaround is used to handle this.  This means however that years after 2000AD require five digits, which is also not supported by the format!  The output file is therefore likely to be viewed as invalid by some programs nevertheless we shall try to continue.
tucson.range.noBodge           = Years in BC range are not supported in Tucson format files.  The +8000 year workaround has not been enabled so the output file is likely to be viewed as invalid by some programs but we will nevertheless try to continue.
tucson.range.usingBodge        = Years in BC range are not supported in Tucson format files.  The +8000 years work around is being used, so all years in this file will be plus 8000.
