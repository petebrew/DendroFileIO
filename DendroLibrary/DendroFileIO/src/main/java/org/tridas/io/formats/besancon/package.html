<p>The Besançon format is used in various forms in a number of laboratories, mostly in France.  It contains both data and (some)
metadata and also allows for a lot of free text comments inline.  In fact, the specification requires that 
any line within the metadata block that cannot be interpreted as metadata must be ignored by the reading 
process.</p>

<h2>File contents</h2>

<p>In Besançon terminology an 'Element block' is equivalent to a series.  Each file can have one or more
element blocks.  Each element block is made up of three parts:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Header line</li>
 <li>Metadata</li>
 <li>Data block</li>
</ul>


<h3>Header line</h3>

<p>The header line denotes the beginning of an element block (~series).  Line prior to the header line are
therefore ignored.  A header line is written as follows:

<table border=1>
<tr>
<td>.</td><td>one or more spaces</td><td>element name</td><td>one or more spaces</td><td>ignored characters</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The element name must be a string with no spaces.</p>

<h3>Metadata</h3>

<p>Metadata is provided with a number of keywords: </p>

<ul>
<li>Especies (species)
<li>Longeur (length)
<li>Position (relative year position)
<li>Origine (calendar date of first ring)
<li>Terme (origine + longeur)
<li>Moelle (pith)
<li>Cambium
<li>Aubier (sapwood - relative number of ring where sapwood begins).  
</ul>

<p>In many Besançon files the whole key is given, but only
the first three letters of each is required so if some files that is all that is present. The keys
are also case insensitive.  For boolean fields
(Moelle and Cambium) the presence of the key indicates 'true' and the absence of the key indicates 'false'.  All 
other fields are written as follows:</p>
<table border=1>
<tr>
<td>one or more spaces</td><td>key</td><td>one or more spaces</td><td>integer</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Each metadata field can be delimited with either a space or a return.  In some files all the metadata appears
on one line, but more commonly each field is presented on its own line.</p>

<h3>Data block</h3>

<p>The data block begins with the following line:</p>
<table border=1>
<tr>
<td>val[eurs[:]]</td><td>ignored chars</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Like the metadata fields, only the first three characters are read, so some files contain 'val' and others 'valeur'.
Also like the metadata fields this is case insensitive.</p>

<p>Next comes the actual data.  Each value is writen as an integer delimited by a space or a return.  Most often this
means that data are written in space delimited decadal lines, but a single line of all values is valid, as is one value
per line and anything inbetween.  Missing measurements are recorded as commas, and following the last data value there
should be a space followed by a semicolon.</p>
