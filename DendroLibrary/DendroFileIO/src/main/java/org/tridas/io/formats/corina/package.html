Mecki Pohl's original (MS-DOS) Corina format.

<p>A Corina file contains yearly data (ring width and number of
samples for that year), some fixed metadata, and optionally
weiserjahre data and a listing of element samples (for summed
samples).</p>

<p>The title comes first, on a line by itself, followed by a blank
line.  The title is repeated later, so this is only to make it
easier for people or external programs (like `head -1`) to read the
title.</p>

<p>The metadata section comes next.  The syntax is <code>;TAG
value</code>.  Tags are all uppercase.  Their order is fixed.  Some
values are terminated by a newline, others by the next
semicolon.</p>

<p>Valid tags, and their internal names, are ID, NAME, DATING,
UNMEAS_PRE, UNMEAS_POST, COMMENTS, COMMENTS2, TYPE, SPECIES,
SAPWOOD, PITH, TERMINAL, CONTINUOUS, QUALITY, FORMAT, INDEX_TYPE,
RECONCILED</p>

On disk, they're stored all-caps; in memory, they're lower-case.
There also exists two special cases, the first being "NAME" on disk is "title" in
memory.  The second second special case if for comments.  Originally
there was both COMMENTS and COMMENTS2 on-disk and in-memory, but
eventually people wanted to type more than 2 lines of comments.
The new semi-backwards-compatible way is: any number of lines of
comments are stored in memory under simply COMMENTS (with embedded
newlines), and on disk as COMMENTS, COMMENTS2, COMMENTS3, ... as
needed.</p>

The order of the tags and position of newlines is as follows:

<pre>
// -- sample meta section (WRITEME)
</pre>

// -- description of tags: index_type, ...

<h3>Data Section</h3>

<p>Every sample has a data section.  It starts with the line:</p>

<pre>
;DATA         
</pre>

<p>(There are 9 spaces after the A.  Don't ask.)</p>

WRITE ME

<p>The data section has a few quirks:</p>

<ul>

  <li>All files have count data, even raw samples.  Unfortunately
  the only way to tell if it's a summed sample is to check for the
  presense of Weiserjahre, Elements, or a count value greater than
  1.  When loading a Corina file, therefore, it has to load all the
  count values, and then throw them out if it turns out to not be
  summed.

  <li>The last line of count data are shifted to the left by 4
  characters.  (Again, don't ask.)

  <li>The count value for the terminating 9990 value is the same as
  the count value for the last measured year, though this has no
  real meaning.

</ul>

<h3>Elements Section</h3>

<p>The Elements section is also optional; only summed samples have
it.  It starts with the line ";ELEMENTS ".  Each line consists of a
complete filename, preceded by a "*" if the sample is <i>not</i>
enabled.  It ends when the next section, Weiserjahre, begins.</p>

<h3>Weiserjahre Section</h3>

<p>The Weiserjahre section is optional; only summed samples have it.  FINISH ME.</p>

<h3>Author Section</h3>

<p>The final tag in a file is the author's name.  The format is:</p>

<pre>
~ author's name
</pre>

<p>Everything after this line is ignored, hence, the <code>~</code>
character is not allowed anywhere in the Corina file.</p>

<h3>Modifications</h3>

<p>There are a couple base features that the Corina filetype can't
handle.  I actually implement a superset of the original Corina
filetype.  It should be 100% backwards-compatible with the original
Corina program, though of course Corina can't take advantage of
these features, and the extra data will be lost if it is loaded and
re-saved in Corina.</p>

<p>The additional features are:

<ul>

  <li>Any number of comment lines.  The Sample class stores
  comments as one long String, possibly with newlines, and this
  class saves them as <code>;COMMENTS</code>,
  <code>;COMMENTS2</code>, <code>;COMMENTS3</code>, etc.  MS-DOS
  Corina will only recognize the first two such lines.

</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>This loader is more forgiving than (MS-DOS) Corina's.  When
reading the metadata tags, the case of the ;-tags doesn't matter,
nor does their order or position of newlines.</p>

<p>This is one of the longest files in Corina, by quite a bit (40%
bigger than all of the crossdating algorithms combined right now),
though it's significantly shorter than it once was
(StreamTokenizers can be more trouble than they're worth).  I'm not
concerned about the length alone, except for the fact that it's
this long and complex and it still doesn't do everything we
want, hence the experiments with XML.</p>
