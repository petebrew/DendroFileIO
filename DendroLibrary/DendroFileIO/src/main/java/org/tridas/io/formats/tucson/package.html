 <p>The Tucson tree ring laboratory's file format. This has been the canonical
 file format since the punchcard days. Unfortunately, since it's just the
 punchcard format in a text file, it has numerous shortcomings:
 <ul>
 <li>minimal metadata support just three 80 character lines in a rigid format that 
 many ignore
 <li>relative/absolute flag starts in column 80 of the title, making it inconvenient to
 edit with most text editors
 <li>officially uses astronomical dates rather than BC/AD so 0 = 1BC etc however most
 people enter data as if it <b>does</b> use BC/AD.  This can cause confusion and data 
 errors.
 <li>only has space for 4 characters to represent years so officially only allows data from
 1000BC (-999) to 9999AD (9999).  People tend either to add 8000 to all years or pinch the
 last character from the keycode to allow them to represent years with 5 characters. Neither
 method is official or documented though.
 <li>no way to store auxiliary numerical data like Weiserjahre
 <li>no way to indicate the variable that has been measured so often people use filenames 
 to indicate early/late wood files
 <li>no way to distinguish with certainty if a summed file is indexed
 <li>no MIME type (even an application/x- one), standard file extension, or telltale
 opening signature
 <li>variety of no data and stop characters used by different programs
 <li>different number of characters used for keycode in different programs (6 or 8)
 </ul>

 What it does do is store dendro data, readable by most dendro programs.

 <h3>File Format</h3>
 <p>
 There are two variants of Tucson files: raw and chronologies. Raw files (RWL) contain
 just ring width values, whereas chronologies also contain 'sample depth/count' values
 alongwide each ring width.
 </p>
 <p>
 Due to there being a minimal specification for the format, implementations over the years
 have introduced many subtle variations which need to be handled.  For instance, the 
 number of keycode characters, the number of characters for the year marker, whether there
 should be any placeholder values after the 'end of data' marker, the units of measurement
 etc etc. This class should handle all popular variants of the Tucon format correctly.
