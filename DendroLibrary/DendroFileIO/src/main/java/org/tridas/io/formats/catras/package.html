<p>This is a binary format for software written by Aniol, first released in 1983.</p> 

<p>Several versions of CATRAS were released over the years, the most recent we have
seen is v4.35 released in 2003.  It is uncertain if there have been changes made 
over the years. The code in this library is based on Matlab, Fortran and C code of
Ronald Visser, Henri Grissino-Mayer and Ian Tyers.</p> 

<h3>File contents</h3>

<p>The first 128 bytes contain the file header information and the remainder of the file 
contains the ring width data and sample depth data.  Our current understanding of the 
header bytes is as follows but I'm not convinced that these are all correct:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1-32 - Series name</li>
    <li>33-40 - Series code</li>
	<li>41-44 - File extension</li>
	<li>45-46 - Series length</li>
	<li>47-48 - Sapwood length</li>
	<li>49-50 - Start year</li>
	<li>51-52 - End year</li>
	<li>53    - 1=pith 2=waldkante 3=pith to waldkante</li>
	<li>54    - 1 = ew only last ring</li>
	<li>55-56 - Start year</li>
	<!--<li>44    - Species code (unique to each lab and corresponds to a separate 'dictionary file'-->
    <li>59-60 species also needs a catras.wnm file
    <li>61-63 - Creation date</li>
	<li>64-66 - Amended date</li>
	<li>67    - Sapwood </li>
    <li>68    - 1=valid stats</li>
    <li>69-75 - dated?</li>
	<li>84    - 0=raw 1=treecurve 2=chronology</li>
	<li>85-86 - User id</li>
	<li>89-92 - Average width </li>
	<li>93-95 - Standard deviation</li>
	<li>96-100 - Autocorrelation</li>
	<li>101-104 - Sensitivity</li>

<p>
The following bytes are unaccounted for and are therefore likely to contain data
that we are ignoring:
 <ul>
 <li>57-58</li>
 <li>69-82</li>
 <li>105-128</li>
 </ul>
