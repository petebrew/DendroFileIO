<p>This is a binary format for software written by Aniol, first released in 1983.</p> 

<p>Several versions of CATRAS were released over the years, the most recent we have
seen is v4.35 released in 2003.  It is uncertain if there have been changes made 
over the years. The code in this library is based on Matlab, Fortran and C code of
Ronald Visser, Henri Grissino-Mayer and Ian Tyers.</p> 

<h2>Reading byte code</h2>

Reading byte code is more complicated than reading text files.  Each byte is 8-bits and 
therefore can represent up to 256 values.  Depending on the type of information each byte
contains, the bytes are interpreted in one of three ways:

<h4>Strings</h4>
<p>Some of the bytes in CATRAS files contain character information.  In the case
each byte represents a letter.  In java an array of bytes can be directly decoded into 
a string.</p>

<h4>Integers</h4>
<p>As a byte can only represent 256 values, whenever an integer is required CATRAS
stores them as byte pairs.  Each byte pair consists of a least significant byte (LSB) and a 
most significant byte (MSB).  The order that they appear in files typically varies between 
platforms and is known as 'endianness'.  As CATRAS solely runs of Microsoft (x86) processors 
we can safely assume that all CATRAS files will be using little-endian (i.e. LSB MSB). The counting
 in a byte pair therefore works as follows:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>LSB</td><td>MSB</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
<tr><td>255</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
<tr><td>255</td><td>255</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A byte pair can therefore store 256x256=65536 values (more than
enough for most number fields).  Matters are complicated though by the need to store negative 
numbers.  In CATRAS pairs with an MSB<=128 are positive, while pairs with an MSB ranging from
255 to 128 (counting backwards) represent negative values.</p>  

<h4>Categories</h4>
<p>Categories are typically recorded as single bytes as most categories have just a few possible values. They 
can therefore be conceptualised as being integers where 0=first option, 1=second option etc. The exception
to this is for species as there are more than 256 species.  In this case, a byte pair is used in 
exactly the same way as described for integers above.  The only problem for species is that the codes
are unique to each laboratory and refer to values enumerated in a separate '.wnm' file.  Without this
dictionary the species code is of little use.</p>

<h4>Dates</h4>
<p>
Dates are stored as three single bytes, one for day, one for month, one for year.  With only 256 
values available for 'year', all dates are stored with 2 digit years e.g. 25/12/84.  When converting
to TRiDaS all years >70 are treated as 20th century, whereas years <70 are treated as 21st century. 
This is an arbitrary decision for use in this library as CATRAS does not care either way.
</p>


<h2>Metadata</h2>

<p>The first 128 bytes contain the file header information and the remainder of the file 
contains the ring width data and sample depth data.  Our current understanding of the 
header bytes is as follows but I'm not convinced that these are all correct. Deciphering these
is a requires painstaking work because we must try to ascertain how each byte is being used (e.g.
as a byte pair, single byte or as a string):</p>

<ul>
	<li>1-32 - Series name</li>
    <li>33-40 - Series code</li>
	<li>41-44 - File extension</li>
	<li>45-46 - Series length</li>
	<li>47-48 - Sapwood length</li>
	<li>49-50 - Start year</li>
	<li>51-52 - End year</li>
	<li>53    - 1=pith 2=waldkante 3=pith to waldkante</li>
	<li>54    - 1 = ew only last ring</li>
	<li>55-56 - Start year</li>
    <li>59-60 species also needs a catras.wnm file
    <li>61-63 - Creation date</li>
	<li>64-66 - Amended date</li>
	<li>67    - Sapwood </li>
    <li>68    - 1=valid stats</li>
    <li>69-75 - dated?</li>
	<li>84    - 0=raw 1=treecurve 2=chronology</li>
	<li>85-86 - User id</li>
	<li>89-92 - Average width </li>
	<li>93-95 - Standard deviation</li>
	<li>96-100 - Autocorrelation</li>
	<li>101-104 - Sensitivity</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The remaining bytes in the file contain the actual data values stored as integer byte pairs.  It appears
that older version of CATRAS included one or more padding values of -1.  These values should be ignored. 
The end of the data values are indicated by a stop value of 999.</p>

<p>Following the ring width data values there are 42 bytes of unknown meaning.  These are then followed by 
byte pairs representing the counts/sample depth for each ring if the series is a chronology. 

<h2>Unknown bytes</h2>

There are a number of bytes in both the header and data sections that are are unaccounted for 
and are therefore likely to contain data that we are ignoring:
<ul>
<li>Header
  <ul>
    <li>57-58</li>
    <li>69-82</li>
    <li>105-128</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Data</li>
 <ul>
   <li>0-42 following end of data marker</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>
