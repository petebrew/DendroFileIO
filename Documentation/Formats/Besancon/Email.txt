Emails from Cath Lavier

Dear Esther and Peter
sorry but I am absent from several weeks in many different places in  
France and Italy, with a broken labtop, in the heart of the  
countryside with no (often) access to internet (I finally found a  
cybercafé lost in nowhere… I hope it works) and Rémi was at hospital  
to extract a bad thing from his body. We were afraid because it was  
twice on the operating table but it seems to be ok now for him.
I have just read your messages, we thought the software we sent to  
Peter was useful.
So I asked help from Pousset/locatelli (LEB2d:  
http://www.dendro.fr/index.html) I work with: we use the same  
softwares/data format etc, they sent me an example (attached file in  
.TXT format) with all the parameters and here are the explanations:

. Mensor_measurement  : name of the serie (about 24 characters  
authorized, with no blank)
LON : number of tree ring measured
ESP : species (espèce) text free of 5 char, here QUERCUS but we also  
use the ITRDB format
MOE : when pith is observed (moelle), if not, no MOE
AUB : sapwood (aubier), and the number of the ring it begins
CAM : when last ring under bark is present ("cambium") and the season  
if we can determine it : HIV = winter (hiver), ETE = summer (été) and  
PRI = spring (printemps)
ECO : when bark is present (écorce)
ORI : date of the first dated ring (origine), if prehistoric date : "-2934"
TER : date of the last dated ring (terme)
POS : position in a mean, 1 by default
VALeur NAT : to introduce the data in 1/100 mm
"," is a ring whe observed but we are not able to measure
";" to announce the serie is finished.
":" to announce the end of the file

I have to leave and I ‘d be at home on Sunday, Monday is a bankholiday  
(I help my son for his exams), Tuesday I will be at Paris again.
I hope it will help,
Warm regards and good continuation
Cath (and for Rémi)

Hi Peter
all our series are built after a program named SYLPHE and have the  
same format I sent you
but other old programs (we never use them more), wrote at Besançon  
many years ago, produced various kinds of files
see
http://chrono-eco.univ-fcomte.fr/Public/DataBases/DendroTmp/DData/
where, at that time, we put various data in various forms.
In my lab and other labs using SYLPHE, we no more use these one  
because too various formats, all was put in the format we sent you.

for what you sent, yes the best is that programs have to read the  
first 3 letters of the code, to count the blank char. and to read the  
data (number, date, ...), it is what we did several years ago to  
integrate data in  SYLPHE.

sorry for not answer exactly what you need and I am not sure to be so  
clear with my English
I can send you more but only on next Wednesday morning at lab.
I hope it will work
nice WE
cath
