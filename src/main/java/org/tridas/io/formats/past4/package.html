<p>
This package contains support for the native XML format used SCIEM's PAST4 software.  The format supports both data and extensible metadata.
It is different from most in that it also contains a lot of settings and display information for the PAST4 software, e.g. what
color to display for each series, whether the series is highlighted or not etc.
