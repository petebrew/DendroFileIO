This is a simple, relatively dated, data-only chronology format.  Series are presented in columns,
as micron integers padded to four characters wide. Like Heikkenen Single, the data runs from bark 
to pith.  The relative dates are shown by padding the starts and ends of series with zeros to show
their relative placements.
