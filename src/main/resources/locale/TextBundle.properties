fileio.invalidDecadeMarker      = The year marker for this data line ({0}) is not within a decade of the last year marker ({1}) for this data series so we cannot continue.  There could be a typographical error in your data, the year markers might not be sequential or perhaps your data file contains multiple series with non-standard header lines.

namingconvention.uuid.description         = This naming convention gives files a name based on the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).  A UUID is consists of 32 hexadecimal digits which are essentially random in that the changes of a collision are astronomically large.

sheffield.blankLine          = No line may be blank in Sheffield format files.
sheffield.invalidDateType    = The date type for this file is invalid. Defaulting to 'R' (relative).

sheffield.specialCharWarning = Lines 1, 8, 17 and 18 should not contain any of the following special characters " , ( ).

tridas.incorrectIDefaultFields = Incorrect IDefaultFields class.  Use class '{0}'

tucson = Tucson

tucson.ignoredFieldDescription = These data were imported from a Tucson file using the TRiDaS Dendro IO Library.  The following line(s) of non-standard metadata were ignore:
tucson.investigator            = Investigator
tucson.investigator.truncated  = Investigator name length truncated from {0} characters to the maximum allowed (61).
tucson.latitude                = Latitude
tucson.latitude.invalid        = Latitude must be <90 and >-90.  Value supplied is {0}. Grid reference will be excluded.",

tucson.range                   = Range
tucson.range.8000BC            = Values before 8000BC are unrepresentable in Tucson format files.  The output file is likely to be viewed as invalid by some programs but we will nevertheless try to continue.
tucson.range.8000BCand2000AD   = Your dataset spans from before 1AD until after 2000AD.  The Tucson format is unable to represent years BC so the +8000 year workaround is used to handle this.  This means however that years after 2000AD require five digits, which is also not supported by the format!  The output file is therefore likely to be viewed as invalid by some programs nevertheless we shall try to continue.
tucson.range.noBodge           = Years in BC range are not supported in Tucson format files.  The +8000 year workaround has not been enabled so the output file is likely to be viewed as invalid by some programs but we will nevertheless try to continue.
tucson.range.usingBodge        = Years in BC range are not supported in Tucson format files.  The +8000 years work around is being used, so all years in this file will be plus 8000.
tucson.siteCode                = SiteCode
tucson.siteCode.truncated      = Site code should be no more than 6 characters.  Your code is {0} characters so has been truncated.
