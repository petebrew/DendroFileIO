tucson.about.description              = The Tucson decadal ring width format evolved from the original punch card format used in the 1970's and 80's.  It is currently the format used for storing data in the Interntional Tree Ring Databank.
tucson.about.fullName                 = Tucson Decadal Ring Width Format
tucson.about.preferredFileExtension   = rwl
tucson.about.shortName                = Tucson
tucson.before1000BC                   = The series '{0}' contains data prior to 1000BC which the Tucson format is unable to represent. This series will be ignored.
tucson.before1AD                      = Data includes years prior to 1AD.  This file is being written using astronomical dates as required by the Tucson specification.  Therefore 1 = 1AD, 0 = 1BC, -5 = 6BC and -999 = 1000BC.  Many people store BC data in Tucson files using calendar years therefore you may come across a 1 year offset when comparing data files.
tucson.blankLine                      = Line {0} is blank which is not allowed in Tucson format files.
tucson.decadeMarkerNotNumber          = Decade marker is not a number.
tucson.fiveCharYears                  = The specification for the Tucson format only allows for 4 characters for years.  This file uses five characters by using the final character of what should be the keycode.  Although the library supports this, there may be unintended consequences.
tucson.ignoredFieldDescription        = These data were imported from a Tucson file using the TRiDaS Dendro IO Library.  The following line(s) of non-standard metadata were ignore:
tucson.invalidCompDate                = Unable to parse the completion date
tucson.invalidDecadeMarker            = This file contains the value '{0}' at the point where a decade marker is expected.
tucson.invalidElevation               = Invalid value for elevation field
tucson.invalidFirstYear               = The 'first year' header field for is invalid
tucson.investigator                   = Investigator
tucson.investigator.truncated         = Investigator name length truncated from {0} characters to the maximum allowed (61).
tucson.latlong                        = LatLong
tucson.latlong.notnull                = Latitude and/or longitude can't be null.
tucson.linkSeriesMissing              = No series matching the linkedSeries references within the derivedSeries could be found in this project.  Without these series we are unable to get the associated metadata.
tucson.newSeriesSameCode              = The year marker for this line suggests this is a new series, but the series code is the same as the previous series in the file.  As each series must have a unique identifier this file cannot be converted.  The most common reason for this is when several data blocks of different measurement variables for the same series are included in the same file.  This is a non-standardised use of the Tucson format and cannot therefore be supported.  
tucson.nonstandardHeader              = The metadata lines in this file do not conform to the Tucson specification.  To ensure erroneous information is not transferred to your output files, no attempt will be made to extract metadata from these lines.
tucson.nonstandardHeaderLine          = The following line does not match standard header or data line patterns
tucson.range                          = Range
tucson.range.8000BC                   = Values before 8000BC are unrepresentable in Tucson format files.  The output file is likely to be viewed as invalid by some programs but we will nevertheless try to continue.
tucson.range.8000BCand2000AD          = Your dataset spans from before 1AD until after 2000AD.  The Tucson format is unable to represent years BC so the +8000 year workaround is used to handle this.  This means however that years after 2000AD require five digits, which is also not supported by the format!  The output file is therefore likely to be viewed as invalid by some programs nevertheless we shall try to continue.
tucson.range.noBodge                  = Years in BC range are not supported in Tucson format files.  The +8000 year workaround has not been enabled so the output file is likely to be viewed as invalid by some programs but we will nevertheless try to continue.
tucson.range.usingBodge               = Years in BC range are not supported in Tucson format files.  The +8000 years work around is being used, so all years in this file will be plus 8000.
tucson.relativeDates                  = There is no method for flagging a dataset as relatively dated in Tucson format.  Please note that year numbers in this file are arbitrary. 
tucson.siteCode                       = SiteCode
tucson.siteCode.truncated             = Site code should be no more than 6 characters.  Your code is {0} characters so has been truncated.
tucson.siteName                       = SiteName
tucson.siteName.truncated             = Site name truncated from {0} characters to the maximum allowed (50).
tucson.speciesName                    = SpeciesName
tucson.speciesName.truncated          = Species name truncated from {0} characters to the maximum allowed (8).
tucson.stateCountry                   = StateCountry
tucson.stateCountry.truncated         = State/country truncated from {0} characters to the maximum allowed (13).",
tucson.unableToDetermineCRNorRWL      = Don't have enought to go on to determine if this is a chronology or ring width file.
tucson.unableToDetermineKeycodeSize   = Unable to determine keycode size.  Tucson files can have keycodes that are either 6 or 8 characters long but the pattern of the data lines in this file do not match either 6 or 8 character keycodes.
tucson.unknownVariableUnitsUnhandled  = Tucson files were designed to store ring width data only, but the file you are outputing contains data for another variable type.  Although this is commonly done, there are no conventions for handling units for such data.  The resulting file may therefore be unsuitable, especially if the data being written is decimal as Tucson files round these to whole numbers.
