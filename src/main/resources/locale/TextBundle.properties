tucson.longitude.invalid            = Longitude must be <180 and >-180.  Value supplied is {0}. Grid reference will be excluded.
tucson.newSeriesSameCode            = The year marker for this line suggests this is a new series, but the series code is the same as the previous series in the file.  As each series must have a unique identifier this file cannot be converted.  The most common reason for this is when several data blocks of different measurement variables for the same series are included in the same file.  This is a non-standardised use of the Tucson format and cannot therefore be supported.

tucson.range.8000BCand2000AD        = Your dataset spans from before 1AD until after 2000AD.  The Tucson format is unable to represent years BC so the +8000 year workaround is used to handle this.  This means however that years after 2000AD require five digits, which is also not supported by the format!  The output file is therefore likely to be viewed as invalid by some programs nevertheless we shall try to continue.
tucson.range.noBodge                = Years in BC range are not supported in Tucson format files.  The +8000 year workaround has not been enabled so the output file is likely to be viewed as invalid by some programs but we will nevertheless try to continue.
tucson.range.usingBodge             = Years in BC range are not supported in Tucson format files.  The +8000 years work around is being used, so all years in this file will be plus 8000.

tucson.siteCode.truncated           = Site code should be no more than 6 characters.  Your code is {0} characters so has been truncated.
