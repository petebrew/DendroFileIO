catras.speciesCodeNotConvertable = There is no standardized species code list for CATRAS files therefore the species for this series cannot be determined.

heidelberg.failedToInterpretDataTypeString = The value '{0}' is not a recognized data type.

seasons.autumn = Fall

tucson.newSeriesSameCode = The year marker for this line suggests this is a new series, but the series code is the same as the previous series in the file.  As each series must have a unique identifier this file cannot be converted.  The most common reason for this is when several data blocks of different measurement variables for the same series are included in the same file.  This is a non-standardized use of the Tucson format and cannot therefore be supported.
